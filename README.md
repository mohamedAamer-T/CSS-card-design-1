# CSS-card-design-1
HTML &amp; CSS for designing Cards

Creating the first design of the cards decoration blocks.
Certainly, there will be a lot of edits and updates from that design:
  1.  creating different ideas for CSS display.
  2.  Manipulating and animation with JS.
  3.  changing in media queries
when finishing any of these updates these will be committed in a new branch. I will make sure not to delete any branch of these branches.

That UI design was created by "nicePage", which allows the client to use the UI design not to sell it.
NOTE: the "first-upload" branch is the only UI design from "nicePage", anything elese of the edits and updates which will be added to the main branch or any other branch not from "nicePage".
