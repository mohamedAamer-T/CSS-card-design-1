# CSS-card-design-1

Creating the first design of the cards decoration blocks.<br>
Certainly, there will be a lot of edits and updates from that design:
  1.  creating different ideas for CSS display.
  2.  Manipulating and animation with JS.
  3.  changing in media queries.<br>

when finishing any of these updates these will be committed in a new branch. I will make sure not to delete any branch of these branches.<br>

That UI design was created by "nicePage", which allows the client to use the UI design not to sell it.<br>
NOTE: the "first-upload" branch is the only UI design from "nicePage", anything elese of the edits and updates which will be added to the main branch or any other branch not from "nicePage".<br>
